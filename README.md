#### Live Web site ####

* [Site generator JS](https://sitegeneratorjs.appspot.com) hosted on Google Application engine


#### Only JS ####

All content in Web page is saved in main.js and page_0.js files.

There is no need for CSS, HTML or any other markup language. The existing CSS is great, focus on your content.

No database, npm, Angular, JQuery, node.js, Babel, Browserify, Promise, back end ...

All components get data dynamically and self inject as  &lt;section&gt;...&lt;/section&gt; into page body element using client processor.


With basic ECMAScript 6 knowledge, there is no learning curve.
However, you can write HTML instead text if you like or use all those libs.
Our intention is to give you a choice NOT to use it, to make your site less dependable.


Happy coding!
