#### Edit anywhere ####

Browser and text editor are all that you need to create site.

#### Run anywhere ####

No server needed!
You can run this site from file or form any Web server.

#### Save anywhere ####

Paths are relative.
You can save and run index.html from flash drive, phone or tablet storage.

#### Only JS ####

All content of the web page are saved in  main.js and  page_xxx.js files. There is no need for css, html or any markup language. Existing css is great, take care about your content.
No: database, npm, Angular, JQuery, node.js, Babel, Browserify, Promise, back end ... All components gets data dynamicaly and self inject as &lt;section&gt;...&lt;/section&gt; into page body element using client processor.
With basic ECMAScript 6 knowledge, there is no learning curve.
However, you can write HTML instead text if you like or use all those libs.
Our intention is to give you a choice NOT to use it, to make your site less dependable.

Happy coding!
